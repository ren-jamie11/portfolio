## Work Experience

**Qube Research & Technologies**  
*Quant Research Intern (Feb – Apr 2025)*

- Constructed 4 high-frequency strategies using microstructure tick data to predict forward returns in crypto futures
- Applied hypothesis testing across 250 crypto products over 15-month period to verify proposed implementation outperforms existing one  
- Built dashboard pipeline to visualize strategy performance (PnL, Sharpe ratio, signal vs return regression, autocorrelation, etc.).

**Squarepoint Capital**  
*Quant Research Intern (Jun – Aug 2024)*
 
- Implemented Bloomberg chat parser that maps broker quotes to securities using regex with >90% recall and >95% accuracy 
- Ran parser on 120k+ messages over 65 days to provide novel insights on trade flow and broker selection
- Created daily automated dashboard that aggregates raw trade data into detailed yet easy-to-read report for senior management

## Projects

#### [Book Recommender with GoodReads Scraper](https://github.com/ren-jamie11/book_recommender/tree/main)

- Personalized book recommender using Goodreads data collected with parallelized BeautifulSoup scraper (16K+ books, 175K+ users, 470K+ ratings) 
- Provides recs from k-most-similar users based on genre preferences and individual book ratings (using normalized user-item matrix and cosine similarities)
- Easy to use: Enter Goodreads user_id to pull user data from website and provide recommendations in <10 seconds
- Full-stack project covering data engineering, feature design, and ML techniques (collaborative filtering, user-based neighborhood models)


#### [Yield Curve Modeling with Nelson-Siegel + Linear Regression](https://github.com/ren-jamie11/nelson_siegel)

Applied dimension reduction technique to transform US Treasury yield curve to time series of (β₁, β₂, β₃), then analyzed regression results of macroeconomic variables on these new response features vs. OLS on original yield curve values 

#### [Poker Hand vs Range Probability Tool](https://github.com/ren-jamie11/poker_gui)

Built a Python application that displays exact probabilities of each hand type and opponent's win odds on flop, turn, and river when given opponent's hand range.
