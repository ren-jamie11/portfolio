# [Aspiring Data Scientist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jren19/)

I am eager to apply my quant finance background to data science, where I can help companies develop outstanding digital products for customers. I have experience:
- Designing and implementing large-scale recommender systems
- Building end-to-end data pipelines and analytics tools 
- Applying ML techniques to construct predictive models
  
**Tech stack**
Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tkinter, regex, beautiful soup), SQL

## Education
**Carnegie Mellon University \|** *M.S. Computational Finance (Dec 2024)* 

**New York University \|** *B.A. Mathematics, B.S. Business (May 2023)*

## Work Experience

**Qube Research & Technologies**  
*Quant Research Intern (Feb – Apr 2025)*

- Constructed 4 high-frequency strategies using microstructure tick data to predict forward returns in crypto futures
- Applied hypothesis testing across 250 crypto products over 15-month period to verify proposed implementation outperforms existing one  
- Built dashboard pipeline to visualize strategy performance (PnL, Sharpe ratio, signal vs return regression, autocorrelation, etc.).

**Squarepoint Capital**  
*Quant Research Intern (Jun – Aug 2024)*
 
- Implemented Bloomberg chat parser that maps broker quotes to securities using regex with >90% recall and >95% accuracy 
- Ran parser on 120k+ messages over 65 days to provide novel insights on trade flow and broker selection
- Created daily automated dashboard that aggregates raw trade data into detailed yet easy-to-read report for senior management

## Projects

#### [Book Recommender with GoodReads Scraper](https://github.com/ren-jamie11/book_recommender/tree/main)

- Personalized recommender using data collected with parallelized BeautifulSoup scraper (16K+ books, 175K+ users, 470K+ ratings) 
- Generates recs from k-most-similar users using genre preferences and book ratings via normalized user-item matrix and cosine similarities
- Easy to use: Enter Goodreads user_id to pull user data from website and provide recommendations in <10 seconds
- Full-stack project covering data engineering, feature design, and ML techniques (collaborative filtering, user-based neighborhood models)


#### [Yield Curve Modeling with Nelson-Siegel + Linear Regression](https://github.com/ren-jamie11/nelson_siegel)

- Applied parametric dimension reduction technique to transform US Treasury yield curve data spanning 20 years to time series of (β₁, β₂, β₃)
- Analyzed regression results of macroeconomic variables on these new response features vs. OLS on original yield curve values 

#### [Poker Hand vs Range Probability Tool](https://github.com/ren-jamie11/poker_gui)

- Built Python app with GUI that displays real-time poker analytics, hand probabilities and win odds
- Calculates exact probabilities of each hand given flop and opponent's range assumptions in 0.1 second
